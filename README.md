# 🔧 Install with (Lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "CharaD7/nvim-jetbrainsai-proxy",
  dependencies = {
    "folke/noice.nvim",
    "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
    "rcarriga/nvim-notify",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
  },
  config = function()
    require("jetbrainsai").setup({
      -- Optional: Disable auto token prompt
      auto_prompt = true,
    })
  end
}
```

# 🧑‍💻 Setup

During setup, you'll be prompted to enter your:

- `JetBrains JWT` token

- `JetBrains Bearer` token

- _(Optional)_ Encryption passphrase to securely store these credentials

> 🛡️ You are solely responsible for providing your own tokens. This plugin does not bypass or spoof any licensing or authentication.

To retrieve your valid tokens, you'll need to run the proxy locally, authenticated with your JetBrains session.

___ 
## 🐳 Running the Proxy (To Acquire Tokens)

Jetbrains AI credentials must be extracted from your own session using the official IDE. This plugin does not ship with authentication,
and you will need your own tokens to connect.

__Step 1:__ Clone the repo and navigate to the proxy directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CharaD7/nvim-jetbrainsai-proxy.git

cd nvim-jetbrainsai-proxy/proxy
```

__Step 2:__ Install dependencies and validate your setup

```bash
make verify
make bootstrap
```

> __NB:__ You will need docker or podman for this to work for you.

__Step 3:__ Open any Jetbrains IDE and initiate the AI chat.

__Step 4:__ Use IDE DevTools plugin to inspect a network request to Jetbrains AI chat

__Step 5:__ Extract the key information:

- `Authorization: Bearer ...`
- `jb-access-token: ...`

__Step 6:__ Fill in the `config.yaml` like so:

```bash
tokens:
  - jwt: "<your-grazie-authentication-jwt>"
  bearer: "<your_bearer_here>" # can be blank
```


__Step 7:__ Start the proxy

```bash
docker build -t jetbrains-proxy .
docker run -p 8080:8080 jetbrains-proxy
```

## 🔐 Encrypted Token Setup and Storage

You can securely store your JetBrains AI tokens using AES-256 encryption.

1. Run `:JetbrainsAISetup`
2. When prompted, enter a 
  - JWT token
  - Bearer token
  - (Optional) passphrase to encrypt your tokens
3. Tokens are stored at `~/.cache/nvim-jetbrainsai/tokens.enc`

> ⚠️ If you skip encryption, tokens are stored in memory only and will not persist.

### 🧠 Smart Token Loading

If you’ve saved encrypted tokens before, the plugin will:

- Detect the token file on startup
- Prompt you once to enter your passphrase (optional)
- Skip completely if no token is saved or prompt is canceled

You’ll never be blocked by required input during startup.

### 🔐 Ergonomic Token Loading

This plugin will check for encrypted tokens on startup only if:

- You've previously stored them via `:JetbrainsAISetup`
- `auto_prompt = true` (default)

Otherwise, it stays silent and clean.

You can disable token auto-load entirely:

```lua
require("jetbrainsai").setup({
  auto_prompt = false
})
```

You may also logout via: `:JetbrainsAILogout`
___

# 💻 Keybindings

| Mode | Mapping | Action |
|----|----|----|
| `n` | `<leader>jc` | Start chat prompt |
| `n` | `<leader>js` | Setup tokens (store or encrypt) |
| `n` | `<leader>jl` | Logout (clear memory-stored tokens) |

___

## 🩺 Health Check

To validate setup, run:

```vim
:checkhealth nvim-jetbrainsai-proxy
```

The plugin will check:

- 🔐 Token presence or encryption status

- 🌐 Proxy availability

- 🧰 Required dependencies (curl, openssl)

- 🧠 Neovim version & runtime paths

# 🙋 FAQ

**Q: Where do I get my JetBrains tokens?**  
A: Run mitmproxy and route IDE traffic through it. Look for `grazie-authenticate-jwt` in the headers on `/chat/stream` calls.

**Q: Why is my token not working?**  
A: It's likely expired or missing required scopes. Try triggering a new AI interaction in WebStorm or IntelliJ.

**Q: How do I avoid committing secrets?**  
A: Use `.env` + `make gen-config`. We've already `.gitignore`d `config.yaml` for safety.

**Q: Can I contribute a plugin for VS Code/other editors?**  
A: Absolutely! PRs welcome if they route via this proxy.
